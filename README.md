# jekyll-theme-ascii

Simple theme that relies mostly on ASCII characters. And maybe emojis :).


## Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "jekyll-theme-ascii"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: jekyll-theme-ascii
```

For `github-pages` you must use the following line instead:

```yaml
remote_theme: jekyll-theme-ascii
```

Finally execute:

```
bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```
gem install jekyll-theme-ascii
```
